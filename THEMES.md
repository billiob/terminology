on all the following edje groups:

* `BG`: the background color of the terminal

* `GLOW_TXT`: text colors with some glow
* `GLOW_TXT_HIGHLIGHT`: text with glow that is highlighted
* `END_SELECTION`: on selections, the color of the handles used to expand or shrink
  the area of the selection
* `TAB_MISSED`: the number of tabs where a bell has rung, tabs that need
  attention
* `TAB_MISSED_OVER`: same but when the mouse is over that number
* `TAB_TITLE`: the colors of the active tab title
* `BG_SENDFILE` is the background color when there is a sendfile action. See
